					    <div class="half-width">
					    	<p> I&#39m currently based in Sheffield which has more trees per head of population than any other European city and is quoted as England&#39s &#34greenest city&#34. My career began in commercial kitchens but after 15 years as a professional chef I wanted to expand my skill set and had become increasingly interested in the relationship between food production, purchasing, supply and the evolving Tech industry.
							After a couple of start-up projects that fused food and Tech I wanted to move beyond working with developers as simply the &#34food expert&#34 and wanted to get involved more with the Tech side.</p>
					    </div>
					    <div class="half-width">
					    	<p> I had become fascinated looking over the shoulders of colleagues at the mysterious world of code and seeing it merge as tangible digital products and interfaces. It has driven me towards a path to full-stack development. I&#39ve found that the discipline and methodology required to produce high level food is very similar to the skills and philosophy of clean, functional and well written code.
							I now find myself with digital skills complemented by a deep understanding of tangible industries.
							It empowers me to offer a complete service to clients and help them to find solutions to a range of business needs.
